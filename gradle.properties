# Project-wide Gradle settings.

# Specifies the JVM arguments used for the daemon process.
# The setting is particularly useful for tweaking memory settings.
# Consider increasing -Xmx if you have available RAM and experience slow builds.
# 4GB to 8GB is common for medium to large projects.
# If increasing -Xmx significantly, also consider adding -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=1g
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx4g -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=1g -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8

# Enables running tasks in parallel.
# Ensure your project modules are decoupled for this to be most effective.
org.gradle.parallel=true

# Enables the configuration cache for faster build configuration.
# This is highly recommended.
org.gradle.configuration-cache=true

# (Optional but recommended) Enables the Gradle build cache.
# While configuration cache helps, the build cache stores task outputs.
# In modern Gradle versions, this might be implicitly enabled or less critical to set explicitly
# if configuration cache is on, but it doesn't hurt.
org.gradle.caching=true

# Ensures the Gradle Daemon is used (default is true in modern Gradle).
# You generally don't need to set this unless you've disabled it elsewhere.
# org.gradle.daemon=true

# AndroidX package structure. Good to have.
android.useAndroidX=true

# Enables namespacing of each library's R class. Good for performance and correctness.
android.nonTransitiveRClass=true

# Kotlin code style for this project: "official" or "obsolete":
# This does not directly impact build performance but is good for code consistency.
kotlin.code.style=official
